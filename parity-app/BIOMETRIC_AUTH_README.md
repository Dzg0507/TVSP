# Biometric Authentication Implementation

## Overview
The Parity app now includes real fingerprint and Face ID authentication using Expo's Local Authentication library.

## Features
- **Fingerprint Authentication**: Works on Android and iOS devices with fingerprint sensors
- **Face ID Authentication**: Works on iOS devices with Face ID
- **Secure Credential Storage**: User credentials are securely stored and retrieved using biometric authentication
- **Automatic Detection**: The app automatically detects available biometric authentication types
- **Fallback Support**: Falls back to passcode if biometric authentication fails

## How It Works

### 1. Biometric Service (`BiometricService.js`)
- Handles all biometric authentication logic
- Checks device capabilities and enrolled biometrics
- Manages secure credential storage
- Provides authentication methods

### 2. Login Screen Integration
- Automatically detects available biometric types
- Shows appropriate icons (ðŸ‘† for fingerprint, ðŸ‘¤ for Face ID)
- Provides "Enable Biometric" button for first-time setup
- Shows "Use [Biometric Type]" button when enabled

### 3. Authentication Flow
1. User enters email and password
2. Clicks "Enable [Biometric Type]" button
3. Authenticates with current credentials
4. System prompts for biometric authentication
5. Credentials are securely stored
6. Future logins can use biometric authentication

## Usage

### For Users
1. **First Time Setup**:
   - Enter your email and password
   - Click "Enable [Biometric Type]" button
   - Follow the biometric authentication prompt
   - Your credentials are now securely stored

2. **Biometric Login**:
   - Click the biometric button (ðŸ‘† or ðŸ‘¤)
   - Authenticate with your fingerprint or Face ID
   - You'll be automatically logged in

### For Developers
```javascript
import BiometricService from '../services/BiometricService';

// Check if biometric is available
const available = await BiometricService.isBiometricAvailable();

// Authenticate user
const result = await BiometricService.authenticate('Login to your account');

// Enable biometric for user
const enableResult = await BiometricService.enableBiometric('user_id', {
  email: 'user@example.com',
  password: 'userpassword'
});
```

## Security Features
- **Secure Storage**: Credentials are stored using AsyncStorage with biometric protection
- **No Plain Text**: Passwords are never stored in plain text
- **Device-Specific**: Biometric credentials are tied to the specific device
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Credentials are removed when biometric is disabled

## Requirements
- **Android**: Device with fingerprint sensor and Android 6.0+
- **iOS**: Device with Touch ID or Face ID and iOS 8.0+
- **Expo**: expo-local-authentication package

## Error Handling
The implementation includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Device not supporting biometric authentication
- No biometric credentials enrolled
- Authentication failures
- Network errors during credential verification

## Testing
To test the biometric authentication:
1. Run the app on a physical device (simulators don't support biometric authentication)
2. Ensure biometric authentication is set up on the device
3. Try the "Enable Biometric" flow
4. Test the biometric login flow

## Future Enhancements
- Support for multiple biometric types per user
- Biometric authentication for sensitive actions (settings changes, etc.)
- Integration with device security policies
- Biometric authentication for partner linking
